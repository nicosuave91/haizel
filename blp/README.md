# Broker-Lender Platform Monorepo Scaffold

This repository contains the initial scaffolding for the Broker-Lender Platform (BLP) MVP. It provides structured directories, configuration stubs, and placeholder documentation for the database, backend services, rules engine, policy bundles, connectors, and workflow workers.

The generated structure follows the architecture described in the specification, enabling further implementation of PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security, NestJS-based APIs, FastAPI rules engine, Auth0/OPA authorization, connector services, and Temporal workflows.
