# Refactor Plan

## P0 – Immediate Risk Mitigations

1. **Establish production-grade tracing across services**
   - **Rationale:** Health report flagged observability no-ops leading to blind spots in production incident response; missing distributed traces block SLO enforcement.
   - **Owner:** Observability Guild (Priya Shah)
   - **Effort Estimate:** 2 weeks (coordination across `apps` services and `infra` telemetry pipeline)
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - All critical `apps` entrypoints emit OpenTelemetry spans with correlation IDs persisted end-to-end.
     - `infra` tracing collector scaled to handle peak TPS with zero data loss in load test.
     - Dashboards and alerting wired into incident playbooks with on-call sign-off.

2. **Guarantee audit/event durability for compliance feeds**
   - **Rationale:** Health report highlights gaps in audit/event durability jeopardizing regulatory commitments; current Kafka retention and DB consistency checks are insufficient.
   - **Owner:** Compliance Platform Team (Diego Marquez)
   - **Effort Estimate:** 3 weeks (coordinated changes in `apps` emitters, `infra` streaming, and `db` archival)
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - Dual-write strategy with transactional outbox in `apps` services passes chaos testing without event loss.
     - `infra` streaming layer enforces idempotent retries and at-least-once semantics validated in staging drills.
     - Compliance reviewers certify that retention SLAs are met with automated daily verification reports.

## P1 – Near-Term Structural Enhancements

1. **Harden webhook ingress and signature validation**
   - **Rationale:** Health report cites webhook security exposure; current HMAC validation lacks key rotation and rate limiting.
   - **Owner:** Edge Security Team (Lina Cho)
   - **Effort Estimate:** 2 weeks (updates in `apps` gateways and `infra` API mesh)
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - Webhook gateway enforces per-tenant keys with automated rotation and revocation playbooks.
     - `infra` layer introduces adaptive rate limiting and anomaly detection with alerting back to SecOps.
     - Pen-test and red-team exercises confirm mitigated findings with sign-off in security tracker.

2. **Introduce compliance schema versioning guardrails**
   - **Rationale:** Health report noted compliance schema drift creating downstream reconciliation issues.
   - **Owner:** Data Governance Team (Marta Ibarra)
   - **Effort Estimate:** 2.5 weeks (changes to `db` migrations and schema registry tooling)
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - All `db` schema changes flow through a versioned registry with automated diff checks.
     - Backward/forward compatibility tests run in CI with enforced approvals from compliance reviewers.
     - Rollback procedure documented and validated during staged deploy.

## P2 – Long-Term Platform Resilience

1. **Modularize `apps` service boundaries for clearer ownership**
   - **Rationale:** Health report observed cross-team coupling slowing delivery; modular boundaries reduce blast radius and accelerate refactors.
   - **Owner:** Application Architecture Working Group (Nina Patel)
   - **Effort Estimate:** 6 weeks (progressive decomposition and interface definition)
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - Domain-driven contracts established with documented APIs and ownership maps.
     - Shared libraries extracted into versioned packages with automated compatibility tests.
     - Post-refactor throughput metrics demonstrate at least 15% decrease in cross-team dependency blockers.

2. **Evolve `infra` pipeline for self-service observability provisioning**
   - **Rationale:** Health report called out observability no-ops stemming from manual provisioning; self-service reduces toil and drift.
   - **Owner:** Platform Enablement Team (Ibrahim Okoro)
   - **Effort Estimate:** 5 weeks (infrastructure-as-code extensions and developer portal updates)
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - Terraform modules expose standardized tracing, logging, and metrics stacks with policy guardrails.
     - Developer portal workflow enables new service onboarding in under 30 minutes as measured in usability study.
     - Quarterly audits confirm 95% adoption with automated drift detection alerts.

3. **Modernize `db` storage layer for compliance analytics workloads**
   - **Rationale:** Health report identified compliance schema pain and slow analytics refresh; modern storage patterns improve durability and insight cadence.
   - **Owner:** Data Platform Team (Sophia Nguyen)
   - **Effort Estimate:** 8 weeks (hybrid OLTP/OLAP architecture rollout)
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - Implement tiered storage with CDC into analytics warehouse achieving <5 minute latency.
     - Runbook ensures failover drills achieve RPO < 5 minutes and RTO < 30 minutes.
     - Compliance analytics stakeholders validate that quarterly reporting cycle time decreases by 25%.
