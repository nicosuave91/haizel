# Deployment Execution Report

## Build Output
- Ran `pnpm --filter web-app-react build` from the repository root.
- Production bundle generated under `blp/apps/web-app-react/dist/`.

## Outstanding Hosting Tasks
The remaining deployment steps (provisioning hosting, uploading assets, SPA routing configuration, and TLS/redirect validation) require access to external infrastructure providers. These actions could not be performed in the current offline workspace.

## Recommended Next Actions
1. Provision hosting (e.g., AWS CloudFront/S3 or ALB-backed service) that supports both `haizeltechnology.com` and `www.haizeltechnology.com` aliases.
2. Upload/sync `blp/apps/web-app-react/dist/` to the chosen origin and configure the SPA fallback to `index.html` for unmatched routes.
3. Enable TLS termination, enforce HTTPâ†’HTTPS redirects, and verify host header handling for both apex and www domains.
